this is all the information on my remotely controlled arduino tank

by Nik252

Originaly this was just an idea floating in my head, but then i got an oportunity to make this as a school project, now I'm putting this project here so everyone could make similar projects.

The tank is made of 2 main part: The head & The body, each one functioning on their own using seperate arduinos to enable parralel motor movement.
The body is made of 6 wheels, out of them only two are connected to stepper motors.
