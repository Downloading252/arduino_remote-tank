# arduino_remote-tank
This project was a school project of mine. this project utilizes the simple to work with Arduino family, Uno and Mega2560 to be exact together with RF communication using the HC-12 modules.
The tank was originaly designed to look as if it was made out of plates, with the vision being the finale product looking lie a steampunl machine.

The tank itself is made out of 3 parts:
1. The lower part - the body:  
2. The upper part - the head:
3. The controller: An Arduino Uno paired with two joysticks - one for the body and one for the head, a button and two HC-12 modules each communicating on a different frequency.
